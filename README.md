# Night Light Circuit with Photoresistor

This project designed a simple night light circuit that detects the ambient light level. This circuit automatically turns on the LED in dark environments. This way, it functions like a night light.

## üß∞ Materials Used
- 1x LED (blue)
- 1x Photoresistor (LDR)
- 1x NPN Transistor (BC547B)
- 1x Rocker Switch
- 2x 1.5V AA Batteries + Battery Holder
- 1x 1kŒ© Resistor
- 1x 10kŒ© Resistor
- Connection Cables and Ground Plate

## üîß Circuit Description

The resistance of a photoresistor changes depending on the light. When the environment darkens, the resistance of the LDR increases, increasing the voltage level to the base of the transistor. This causes the transistor to conduct, and the LED to turn on. When the environment becomes bright, the resistance of the LDR decreases, the transistor is cut off, and the LED turns off.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Diagram

The circuit was physically designed by soldering directly onto a breadboard. The schematic has not yet been drawn digitally. Below is a photo of the actual circuit:

## üß† Design and Implementation

The circuit was designed entirely using soldering and hand-wiring. The schematic design and implementation were done personally.
